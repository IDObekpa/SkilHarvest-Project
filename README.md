 3. It was also identified that over 95% of its Revenue were generated during working days compared to other working periods.



### Recommedations

 1. SkillHarvest should invest more in the Region contributing more to its Revenue
 2. Since bulk of its Revenue is been generated during the normal working days (95%), I will strong recommend the company employees more employe to work on the normal working days and give incentive for overtime and allow staff rest on weekends/ holidays so they can be more productive during the coming week.

 3. SKillHarvest should pay keen attention to the reason why there is a drop in Revenue in 2015.
